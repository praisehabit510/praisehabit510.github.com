        <p>I have done a variety of sports in my life, but I've settled on a few.</p>
        
        <h3>Eventing</h3>
        <p>This is by far my favorite sport. I've ridden horses for a long time, but only in the past few years have I started eventing, which is a combo of dressage, cross country, and show jumping.</p>
          
        <h3>Swimming</h3>
        <p>I started swimming in 2008, and swam quite frequently with my local USA Swim team for roughly four years. A few years ago I quit the swim, due to shoulder injury. I still love swimming though, I just (unfortunately) am unable to do it as often as I'd like.</p>

        <h3>Diving</h3>
        <p>Once I started swimming for my local high school, I was informed that they had hired a full time dive coach. I decided to try it, and for a time, liked it better than swimming, but in the past year I realized that I do enjoy eventing the most.</p>
       
       <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
        
        <p>I believe I would define my hobby as music.</p>
