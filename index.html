        <h2 id="projects">About</h2>
        <p>SGE is a simple farm. Our colors are navy and yellow, and we are in the USEA's Area 3. We often show at Poplar Place Farm, Rocking Horse Stables, Florida Horse Park, or, less often, Chatt Hills Eventing.</p>
        
       
       <h2 id="hobbies">Horses</h2>
        
        <p>Some we own, others we've ridden often and keep on our site to remember them:)</p>
        
        <h3>Phenomenon</h3>
        <p>Pheeps, our main horse, is a bay quarter horse that moves like a little Warmblood pony. Unfortunately he has been diagnosed with Navicular's disease, so until we have some spare time, he is currently not showing. We hope that he will be back in the shows soon, we are looking at de-nerving part of his hoof so he doesn't feel pain.  </p>
        

        <h3>Ann-Ticipation</h3>
        <p>Ann is owned by my trainer at DASH. While Pheeps is out of commission, Ann sucessfully took me through my first 3phase show, my first recognized horse trial, my first clear cross country round and my first novice event. Unfortunately she is also currently out of commission due to pregnancy (; she is due to foal in the spring of 2013, so just in case Pheeps does not return she'll be ready to event again in the fall of 2013. Even though this mare is 18, after three hours of cross country schooling she is still raring to go!  </p>
      
        
        <h2 id="fun-facts">For Sale</h2>
        <h3>Ice Cold Ebony</h3>
        <p>Ice is a black-bay eight-year-old American Warmblood (TB, Appaloosa, Percheron). He has jumped up to 2' 6" with a rider, and higher in free jumping. He has shown through Training Level Dressage, and has not been out on a cross country course. Currently selling for $3500. </p>
